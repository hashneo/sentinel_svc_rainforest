jwt-verification-client
========================

A client library that abstracts calling a JWT verification service

NOTE: This library was built for Concur, but any one can use it, assuming you have a JWT verification service

npm install jwt-verification-client --save


// assuming your JWT verification service is running on localhost port 8100:

var v = require('./jwt-verification-client')('http://localhost:8100');

var jwt = 'your JWT text goes here. Where you get it is your business..';

var result = v.verify(jwt); // verify returns a promise

result.then(function(valid) {console.log(valid)}, function(err) {console.log(err)});
